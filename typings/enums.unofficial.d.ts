// These are unofficial enums contributed by the community
// We have to use const enums here instead of normal enums because the corresponding Lua globals do
// not exist
// https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html
// Alternatively, we could create new global enums, but that would pollute the global namespace

// Some of the official enums repeat themselves inside of the properties
// e.g. "CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SAD_ONION" is better written as "CollectibleType.SAD_ONION"
// As a standard, enums in this file do not use any unnecessary prefixes
